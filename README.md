### Watermarking Tool v1.2 â€“ macOS and Windows Release

**Release Date:** June 15, 2025
**Build Types:**

* macOS: Directory-based application (GUI app included in release)
* Windows: Single-file executable (GUI app included in release)

---

#### What's New

* Introduced standalone GUI apps for both macOS and Windows in the release section
* macOS version now uses a directory-based build with `--windowed` for faster startup
* Added Windows support with a PyInstaller-built `.exe` file
* Full offline functionality on both platforms
* Intelligent watermark selection (light/dark) based on image brightness
* Support for image and video watermarking via GUI or CLI

---

#### Included in This Release

* `WatermarkingTool-macOS.zip`: Contains the full application folder. Unzip and run `watermarker_tool` inside. GUI launches automatically.
* `WatermarkingTool-Windows.exe`: Standalone executable for Windows. No installation required. GUI launches on double-click.

---

#### Notes

* Do not separate files inside the macOS app folder. All contents are required for the app to function.
* The Windows `.exe` may take slightly longer to launch on first run due to onefile packaging.
* CLI functionality is also retained in the Python source code version.

## Requirements (for Python source users)

**Python 3.6 or later**
Download: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip3 install pillow opencv-python pillow-heif
```

## How to Use

### GUI Mode (included in release binaries)

Just unzip and run:

* `watermarker_tool` on macOS
* `WatermarkingTool-Windows.exe` on Windows

No Python required for these versions.

### GUI Mode (from Python source)

```bash
python3 watermarker_tool.py --gui
```

The GUI will prompt you to:

* Select image folder or video file
* Add watermark images (light and dark)
* Choose an output folder (optional)
* Set watermark position, margin, and scale

If no output folder is selected, images are overwritten (as `.png`), and videos get `_watermarked.mp4`.

### CLI Mode

```bash
python3 watermarker_tool.py <source> <light_wm> <dark_wm> [options]
```

**Example:**

```bash
python3 watermarker_tool.py ./images ./light.png ./dark.png \
  --output ./out --location bottomright --margin 15 --scale 40
```
